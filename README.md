# DeleteWindowsExplorerHistryItems
A small program that deletes single items from windows explorer histry (the address bar)

## Useful when:
* You change the IP address of your NAS but keep seeing the old address in when you type **\\\\** in the address bar.
* A friend brings his laptop to your home and you access his shared drive to pull some pictures/games/whatever and then this address no longer exists in your network
* You type the exact address of your otherwise hidden share with dirty porn and the address in stuck in the explorer history
* Just want to start fresh explorer history

## Compiled builds
I will soon set up automated building.

## Possible features to be added:
* Mass edit entries to change the IP of your NAS and keep all pathes there
* Add new entries that the explorer keep missing, despite you typing them multiple times
